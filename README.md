# PlayerCompass - Minecraft-plugin
## Minecraft (Manhunt) plugin with GUI, that allows you to track multiple people using compass with custom settings.
Minecraft Version 1.19 (but probably works from 1.14 to newest)

This plugin is different from other manhunt plugins because of customization. You can select Players you want to track, and left-clicking compass changing who you track at the moment. You can also change if it works in the nether or not, and all of that is not by commands, but simple and quick GUI.

* Don't have config file at the moment, and not expected in the near future (if interested, contact me on discord, i will make it happen if i see interest).
* I don't thing there are any bugs, if you experience some let me know please.

## Instalation
1. Find "PlayersCompass-1.1.jar" file .
* Should be in main folder, but if not, then look up in "target" folder.
2) Put this file in "plugins" foler.
3) Done, Enjoy.

Command is: "/tracker"
